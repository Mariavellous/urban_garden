The Urban Garden is an online shopping website selling organic fruits and vegetables in a backyard garden located in the heart of San Jose, CA. 
Using the documentation for Products and Prices on Stripe API, I added fruits and vegetables that my mom plants in her garden so that she can sell the products online and reach a wider audience. The data includes each product's name, price, and an image. 
The shopper can add different products to the shopping cart, and when ready for checkout, the shopper the app leverages Stripe's payment processing platform.
